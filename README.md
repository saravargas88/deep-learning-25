 # Python notebooks for Alfredo Canziani's Introduction to Deep Learning Class

Each notebook illustrates a diffreent concept andits exploration. 

# Projects : 

- Final projects are implementations of  Encoder-Decoder Neural Nets (CNN and RNN).
- Second Project is a personal exploration nof how to improve a models effectiveness at classification by adding noise and ambiguity to the training data
